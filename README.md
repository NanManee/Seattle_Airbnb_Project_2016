- What are the top three locations for Airbnb rentals?
- What are the most popular months of the year for rentals?
- Which types of bedrooms generate the highest revenue per year?

### Insights for Question #1:

All of the top three prime areas are located in Western Washington:

- 98134: The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $206. This area is situated on beautiful Elliott Bay and the Duwamish Waterway, next to downtown Seattle.
- 98119: The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $171. This area is located between Elliott Bay and Lake Union, very close to downtown.
- 98101: The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $167. This area is in downtown Seattle with easy access to Elliott Bay.

### Insights for question #2:

The most popular months of the year for rentals are:

- During May and June, it's late spring and early summer. During these months, temperatures in Seattle begin to warm up, and the city experiences longer daylight hours. It offers pleasant weather conditions, making it a popular time for outdoor activities, events, conferences, and tourism.

- During November and December, it's the holiday season, which sees increased shopping activity, tourism, and events, making them busy months for the city.

### Insights for question #3:

The average price per bedroom per night:

- 1 bedroom = $96
- 2 bedrooms = $175
- 3 bedrooms = $250
- 4 bedrooms = $315
- 5 bedrooms = $450
- 6 bedrooms = $565
  
The types of bedrooms that generate the highest revenue per year:

- 1 bedroom = Approximately $63 million
- 2 bedrooms = Approximately $31 million
- 3 bedrooms = Approximately $18 million
- 4 bedrooms = Approximately $6 million
- 5 bedrooms = Approximately $3 million
- 6 bedrooms = Approximately $1 million

### Recommendations:

I would recommend investing in a one-bedroom Airbnb rental. Although six-bedroom rentals generate the most revenue per night at $585, while one-bedroom rentals only earn $96 per night, the frequency of one-bedroom rentals significantly contributes to the highest revenue per year, approximately $63 million compared to the six-bedroom's $1 million per year. When considering the minimum room rental for a one-bedroom per year, it's about $1.5 million versus approximately $5,500 for a six-bedroom.

The best location would be the 98134 zip code, situated on Elliott Bay and the Duwamish Waterway, next to downtown Seattle. The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $206, the highest compared to other locations.

The prime time to maximize revenue is between May and June. During these months, Seattle's temperatures begin to warm up, and the city experiences longer daylight hours, creating pleasant weather conditions that attract outdoor activities, events, conferences, and tourism. Additionally, November and December are optimal for renting out Airbnb properties due to the holiday season, which sees increased shopping activity, tourism, and events, making them busy months for the city.
