### Insights for Question #1:

All of the top three prime areas are located in Western Washington:

- 98134: The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $206. This area is situated on beautiful Elliott Bay and the Duwamish Waterway, next to downtown Seattle.
- 98119: The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $171. This area is located between Elliott Bay and Lake Union, very close to downtown.
- 98101: The average nightly revenue for room rentals is $167. This area is in downtown Seattle with easy access to Elliott Bay.

### Insights for question #2:

The most popular months of the year for rentals are:

- During May and June, it's late spring and early summer. During these months, temperatures in Seattle begin to warm up, and the city experiences longer daylight hours. It offers pleasant weather conditions, making it a popular time for outdoor activities, events, conferences, and tourism.

- During November and December, it's the holiday season, which sees increased shopping activity, tourism, and events, making them busy months for the city.

### Insights for question #3:

The average price per bedroom per night:

- 1 bedroom = $96
- 2 bedrooms = $175
- 3 bedrooms = $250
- 4 bedrooms = $315
- 5 bedrooms = $450
- 6 bedrooms = $565
  
The types of bedrooms that generate the highest revenue per year:

- 1 bedroom = Approximately $63 million
- 2 bedrooms = Approximately $31 million
- 3 bedrooms = Approximately $18 million
- 4 bedrooms = Approximately $6 million

### Recommendations:

Investing in a one-bedroom Airbnb rental presents a profitable opportunity. Despite the higher revenue per night for six-bedroom rentals at $585 compared to $96 for one-bedroom rentals, the frequency of bookings for one-bedroom properties significantly contributes to higher annual revenue. With approximately $63 million in yearly revenue for one-bedroom rentals compared to $1 million for six-bedroom rentals, the potential return on investment is evident. When considering the minimum room rental for a one-bedroom property per year, which amounts to about $1.5 million, the profitability becomes even more compelling when compared to the approximately $5,500 for a six-bedroom property.

In terms of location, the 98134 zip code stands out as the prime choice. Situated on Elliott Bay and the Duwamish Waterway, adjacent to downtown Seattle, this area offers an ideal blend of accessibility and scenic views. With an average nightly revenue of $206 for room rentals, which is the highest compared to other locations, investors can expect optimal returns in this area.

To maximize revenue, strategic timing is crucial. May and June emerge as the prime months for Airbnb rentals in Seattle. During this period, the city experiences warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours, creating ideal conditions for outdoor activities, events, conferences, and tourism. Additionally, November and December present favorable opportunities due to the holiday season. With increased shopping activity, tourism, and events during these months, Airbnb properties are in high demand, making them busy and profitable months for investors.

In conclusion, investing in a one-bedroom Airbnb rental in the 98134 zip code during the prime months of May, June, November, and December offers the best opportunity for Seattle Airbnb investors to maximize revenue and achieve a strong return on investment.
